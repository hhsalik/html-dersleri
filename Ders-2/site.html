        <p>the person leading the U.S. response to the <a href="https://elemental.medium.com/your-most-pressing-questions-about-the-coronavirus-answered-c99bff5f02e9">coronavirus outbreak</a>, Dr. Nancy Messonnier at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is preparing herself and her family for a possible pandemic that could cause “severe” disruption to everyday life as businesses curtail activity, schools possibly close, and social gatherings are discouraged.</p>

        <blockquote>“We really want to prepare the American public for the possibility that their lives will be disrupted because of this pandemic.”</blockquote>

        <p>That would seem to be already the case. Community spreading — cases that appear without a known source of exposure — are now occurring in Hong Kong, Iran, Italy, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand.</p>
